      "description": "Additional fuzzy/partial matching logic in getProductImages beyond the specified “fallback to productName”.",
      "reason": "REQ-28 requests a two-step lookup (by productId, then by productName) when no images are found. The diff also adds a partial/substring match against mapping.productId (normalized.includes(...) or mapping.productId.includes(normalized)), which is not explicitly requested and may cause unintended matches.",
